Over the past few weeks, our team has dived deep into the world of natural language processing and deep learning, creating a robust model that analyzes and predicts the sentiment of movie reviews. Using cutting-edge techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we've tackled the challenge of understanding the nuanced emotions behind movie reviews.
